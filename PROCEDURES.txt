- Python3 + Python virtual environment + libraries
- Activate Guardium GBDI "Full SQL Nodep" Datamart

- update the param_data.json file to your needs/set up
- cron the execution of the python program by collectors or group of collectors :
	- example:
        ./FullSQLEnrich_X_EK.py xxxxx    with xxxx a pattern to recognize a/several collectors
        if collectors are named like dcprodx00x  with x = digit (dcprodx001, dcprodx002, dcprodx003 ....)
